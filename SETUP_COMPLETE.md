# 🎉 GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Complete!

Your Health Reminder project is now configured for automated builds and releases on GitHub!

## 📦 What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

Three automated workflows were created:

#### ✅ `build.yml` - Continuous Integration
- **Triggers**: On every push to `main` or `develop` branches, and on pull requests
- **Actions**: 
  - Builds the app
  - Verifies build success
  - Uploads build artifacts
- **Purpose**: Catch build errors early

#### 🚀 `release.yml` - Automated Releases
- **Triggers**: When you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Actions**:
  - Builds the app in Release configuration
  - Creates ZIP archive
  - Creates DMG installer
  - Generates checksums
  - Creates GitHub release with all files
  - Adds detailed release notes
- **Purpose**: Automate the entire release process

#### ✔️ `pr-check.yml` - Pull Request Validation
- **Triggers**: On pull requests
- **Actions**:
  - Validates that code builds
  - Posts build status as PR comment
  - Provides build summary
- **Purpose**: Ensure PRs don't break the build

### 2. Helper Scripts (`scripts/`)

Three convenient bash scripts:

#### 🚀 `release.sh` - Automated Release Creator
Interactive script that:
- Validates version format
- Checks for uncommitted changes
- Tests build locally (optional)
- Creates and pushes git tag
- Triggers GitHub Actions release workflow

**Usage**: `./scripts/release.sh v1.0.0`

#### 🔨 `test-build.sh` - Local Build Tester
Quick script to:
- Clean previous builds
- Build app in Release mode
- Verify build output
- Show app size

**Usage**: `./scripts/test-build.sh`

#### 📦 `create-dmg.sh` - DMG Installer Creator
Creates a DMG installer:
- Packages the app
- Adds Applications folder shortcut
- Sets volume name
- Compresses for distribution

**Usage**: `./scripts/create-dmg.sh 1.0.0`

### 3. Documentation Files

Comprehensive documentation:

#### 📖 `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` (14KB)
Complete guide covering:
- Detailed workflow explanations
- Code signing and notarization setup
- Secret configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

- Version naming conventions
- Common commands
- Release checklist

- macOS system files
- Temporary files

#### Updated `README.md`
Added references to:
- Build scripts
- Release documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### First-Time Setup

1. **Push to GitHub**

   If you haven't already, initialize Git and push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/dungne/SourceCode/health-reminder
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with CI/CD setup"
   
   # Create GitHub repository, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/health-reminder.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Actions**

   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on the **Actions** tab
   - GitHub Actions should be enabled automatically
   - You'll see the workflows listed

3. **Test the Build Workflow**

   The build workflow will run automatically on your first push!
   Monitor it at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/health-reminder/actions`

### Creating Your First Release

**Option 1: Using the Release Script (Recommended)**

```bash
# Interactive mode
./scripts/release.sh

# Direct mode
./scripts/release.sh v1.0.0
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Check your code is ready
2. ✅ Test the build locally
3. ✅ Create and push the tag
4. ✅ Trigger GitHub Actions

**Option 2: Manual Process**

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for release v1.0.0"
git push origin main

# 2. Create tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# 3. Push tag (this triggers the release workflow)
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Monitor the Release**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/health-reminder/actions`
2. Watch the "Release" workflow (takes 5-10 minutes)
3. Once complete, visit: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/health-reminder/releases`

## 📋 Typical Workflows

### Daily Development

```bash
# Make changes to code
# ... edit files ...

# Test build
./scripts/test-build.sh

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# Build workflow runs automatically ✅
```

### Pull Request Review

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Push branch
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create PR on GitHub
# PR check workflow runs automatically ✅
```

### Release Process

```bash
# Option A: Automated (recommended)
./scripts/release.sh v1.0.0

# Option B: Manual
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Release workflow runs automatically ✅
```

## 🎯 What Happens on Each Action

### When you push to `main`:
1. ✅ Build workflow runs
2. ✅ App is built and tested
3. ✅ Build artifacts are saved for 7 days
4. ✅ You get notified of any build failures

### When you create a pull request:
1. ✅ PR check workflow runs
2. ✅ Build is validated
3. ✅ Status comment is posted on PR
4. ✅ Build summary is added

### When you push a version tag (`v1.0.0`):
1. ✅ Release workflow runs
2. ✅ App is built in Release mode
3. ✅ ZIP and DMG files are created
4. ✅ Checksums are generated
5. ✅ GitHub release is created automatically
6. ✅ All files are attached to the release
7. ✅ Release notes are added

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Customizing Workflows

Edit the workflow files to:
- Change Xcode version
- Modify build configurations
- Add custom build steps
- Change artifact retention
- Customize release notes

Example - Change Xcode version in `build.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Select Xcode version
  run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_16.0.app/Contents/Developer
```

### Adding Code Signing

For distribution outside development:

1. See the "Code Signing and Notarization" section in `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`
2. Add required secrets to GitHub
3. Use the `release-signed.yml` workflow example

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on GitHub Actions

1. **Check the logs**: Go to Actions tab → Click on failed workflow
2. **Test locally**: Run `./scripts/test-build.sh`
3. **Verify Xcode version**: Ensure GitHub uses correct version
4. **Check dependencies**: Make sure all dependencies are included

### Release Not Created

1. **Verify tag format**: Must start with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. **Check workflow logs**: Go to Actions tab
3. **Ensure permissions**: Check repository Actions permissions

### Scripts Don't Run

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run from project root
cd /Users/dungne/SourceCode/health-reminder
./scripts/release.sh
```

### Tag Already Exists

```bash
# Delete local and remote tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# Create new tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "New message"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test locally first**: Always run `./scripts/test-build.sh` before releasing
2. **Use semantic versioning**: Follow the `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format
3. **Draft releases**: Create draft releases for review before publishing
4. **Keep changelogs**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file for tracking changes
5. **Monitor Actions**: Check the Actions tab regularly for build status
